# Mesage Syntax and Routing

## Key Words for RFC-723/0-5

MUST - absolute requirement of the specification

MUST NOT - absolute prohibition of the specification

SHOULD - mean that there
         may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
         particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
         carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

SHOULD NOT - This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
             there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
             particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
             implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
             before implementing any behavior described with this label.

MAY - This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
             truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a
             particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
             it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
             An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
             include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
             same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
             MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
             does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
             option provides.)

## HTTP Breakdown
* client send http request to a server in the form of request message, starting with reuqest-line (method=toke, URI and protocol version)
followed by header fields with request modifiers, client information and representation metadata, empty line to indicate the end of the header section, and finally a mesage body containing the payload body.
each esponse comes with a statuc line, possibly followed by header files containing server information, resource metadata and representation metadata.

## EXAMPLE:
URL = "http://www.example.com/test.txt"
* **Client Request:**
GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.71 zlib/1.2.3
* **Server Response:**
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Hello World! My payload includes a trailing CRLF.

## Caches
* local store of previous response messages and the subsystem that controls its message storage, retrieval and deletion.
reduces response times and network bandwidth consumption.
acts as a tunnel.
if one has cached response, the req/res chain is shortened.
more of that will be touched in RFC 7234.

## Protocol Versioning
* HTTP-version = HTTP-name "/" DIGIT "." DIGIT
* HTTP-name = %x48.54.54.50 ; "HTTP", case-sensitive
* Resulting in -> HTTP/1.1 -> CONST!
have to send it in the client request.
