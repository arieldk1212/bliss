# Key Words for RFC-2616

MUST - absolute requirement of the specification

MUST NOT - absolute prohibition of the specification

SHOULD - mean that there
         may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
         particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
         carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

SHOULD NOT - This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
             there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
             particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
             implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
             before implementing any behavior described with this label.

MAY - This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
             truly optional. One vendor may choose to include the item because a
             particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
             it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
             An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
             include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
             same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
             MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
             does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
             option provides.)

# Terminology

1. connection -> transport layer virtual circuit for communication purposes.
2. message -> structured sequence, transmitted via the connection.
3. request -> http request msg.
4. response -> http response msg.
5. resource -> network data object or service that can be identified by URI.
6. entity -> req/res MAY transfer an entity (consists entity-header fields and entity-body).
7. representation -> figuring out the best representation for the user's response.
8. content negotiation -> driven from representation, in the entity-body, it tries to give "the best" representation when servicing 
a request, with 3 different negotiations.
9.
